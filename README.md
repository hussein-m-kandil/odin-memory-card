# Odin Memory Card

A simple memory game built as part of studying [**The Odin Project's React course**](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/react). The main goal of this project is to implement the concepts learned so far by using hooks to manage and utilize state while fetching and using data from an external API.
